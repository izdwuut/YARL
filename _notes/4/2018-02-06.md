### DONE

* Install a theme ([I abandoned it](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/7whrvg/sharing_saturday_193/du0fvvf/)).

### PLAN

* Create subpages and fill them with content. I'm going to finish homepage. Maybe some excerpts for a Sharing Saturdays page.
	
### IMPEDIMENTS

* I don't know the tech, but my estimates were really rough, so I'm probably going to be alright.
