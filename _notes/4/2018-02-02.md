### DONE

* A planning phase.


### PLAN

* Comprehend Jekyll documentation.
* Setup Jekyll on my PC.
* Create subpages and fill them with content. I'm going to do some of it.


### IMPEDIMENTS

* A sprint is very doable, but I'm probably going to use a pre-made theme.
* Estimates are rough. I didn't touch web techs in a long time.
