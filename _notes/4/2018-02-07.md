### DONE

* Create subpages and fill them with content. I've done an "Open Source to the core" section.

### PLAN

* Create subpages and fill them with content. 
* Finish Development stack.
* Maybe a Sharing Saturdays page.
* Add a meta description: "A totally unique roguelike with gameplay so dense that 255 character limit woul".
* Justify text.

### IMPEDIMENTS

* I though my velocity would be greater, but again - my estimates were rough.
