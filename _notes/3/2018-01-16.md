Daily Scrum: 5 mins!
Spent: 4 hrs.
```

### DONE

* Pin maintenance cards to a board.
* Create a leveling system that processes experience entities.
* Document changes.
* Fix cleanupTest() method.

### PLAN

* Unit test changes (CombatSystem and LevelingSystem). Yesterday i was struggling with a bug in a cleanUpTest() method.
* Settings use a size component instead of a cell size component. Accessors stay the same.
* Refactor controllers so they declare pausable/resumable only once.
* Add a player's stats layer to a Game Screen.


### IMPEDIMENTS

* I don't know what I am spending all the missing time on. Yesterday I was working for 4 hours, but Trello says it was only 2.
