### DONE

* Create an Experience entity with an Experience and Creature components.
* Modify a creature and add the exp component in a creature factory.
* An exp entity is added to an engine when a creature is killed.

### PLAN

* Add a code maintenance category (refactoring) and put following items in there:
	* An Attacker and defender components inherit a creature component.
	* Settings use a size component instead of cell size component. Accessors stay the same.
	* Refactor events.
	* Do research.
	
* Create a leveling system that processes experience entities.
* Unit test changes.
* Document changes.
* Add a player's stats layer to a Game Screen.
* Split a "Turn counter" card up.
	
### IMPEDIMENTS

* Problems with a workflow might arise.
* I committed to only 20 hours instead of 40. I have to get back to a sprint planning and commit to some more items. I think I will take care of a message log.
