Daily Scrum: 15 mins.
Spent: 4 hrs.
```

### DONE
Yesterday I have done (almost) everything. Yay!

* Unit test changes (CombatSystem and LevelingSystem).
* Settings use a size component instead of a cell size component. Accessors stay the same.
* Refactor controllers so they declare pausable/resumable only once.
* Add a player's stats layer to a Game Screen.

### PLAN

* Document changes.
* A player levels up when he hits an experience breakpoint.
* A player's level.
* Start events refactoring.	
* Unit testing

### IMPEDIMENTS

* I don't spend full 4 hours on the project. It varies.
