`Spent: 3 hrs 45 mins.`

A planning phase is done. Let the rock off begin.

### DONE

\-\-\-


### PLAN

* I want to make player gain experience from killing monsters. I think I'm able to do it. I would probably start unit testing if I'm lucky.
* Remove previous feature branch.


### IMPEDIMENTS

* Trello is a powerful tool and I should discover it little by little. Stick to a current workflow, refine it later.
* Stand-ups have to be brief.
