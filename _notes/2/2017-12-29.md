Daily Scrum: 10 mins.

Yesterday I did everything I plan. I was working overtime to further refactor a flyweight factory and I think I'm done. I just have to review and document it.

Not much is left. I have to test yesterday's work. I also want to do:

* Add setWeapon to a Creature entity.
* Decide how to treat bare fists.
* Create a WeaponComponent with a minDamage and maxDamage fields.

It's all that's left. Job's (almost) done.
