Daily Scrum: 15 mins.

Yesterday I did everything I plan, from unit testing to refactoring. I came up with an idea of flyweight creatures. I implemented them and they work. They're not perfect, though. Today I want to reduce boilerplate code in a FlyweightCreatureFactory class.

I want to unify javadoc annotations.

I plan to make creatures use weapons. I order to do this I have to accomplish:

* Add setWeapon method to an Item entity.
* Add a weaponComponent.
* Add setWeapon to a Creature entity.
* Equip a player with a sword in CreatureFactory.
* Create an ItemFactory that creates items, including weapons.
* Refactor FlyweightCreature to reduce boilerplate code.
* Unit test every change in a system.
* Document every change in a project.
* Refactoring (mentioned above).

My quasi Scrum Board is a mess. These meetings take a long time.

I noticed that I test algorithms instead of expected output. I should prepare a set of input data and test for expected output (especially in a MovementSystem). I'm going to take care of it in the upcoming sprint. I'm also going to use Trello and generate burn-down charts.

I have just realized I have accomplished a sprint goal. Hurrah!. It was what, a week? I planned this sprint to be 2 weeks long. We'll see.
