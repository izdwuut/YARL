Factories can be tested.

Are "A documentation" and "Unit testing" categories in a product backlog really necessary? They are strictly non-functional. Additionally, what is a point of putting a "Use JUnit 5." task in there? It would be problematic to move it on a Scrum Board.

How about a generic factory?
