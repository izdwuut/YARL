Remember that flyweight refactoring I was talking about on Friday? Well it's not done. It took me enormous amount of time and it's still not done. I can't focus on this now, but it's high on my priority list.

There was a severe bug: every flyweight creature had the same position. It was a matter of removing a position component from a constructor.

I still have to do:

* Decide how to treat bare fists.
* I think I should also add a WinScreen to really call a current sprint done.
* Mark a current revision as v0.1.0.
* Fix docs bugs.
