Daily Scrum: 15 mins. It should take what, like 2-3 minutes?

Yesterday was pretty neat. I managed to create a combat system and mark some tasks as done. I was short of time and I didn't manage to write unit tests.  This seems to be a recurring problem. I should probably commit to fewer tasks a day.

I didn't push my changes, I'm going to do it today. I spotted a bug - an app throws a null pointer exception when a player makes a move. This is the first thing on my today's priority list.

I want to write some unit tests. I think that I should focus a little bit more on a documentation. I have yet to think of a convenient way of doing things. If I'm left with enough time, I would add a sword. I would also do some refactoring.
