Daily Scrum: 10 mins.

Yesterday I didn't manage to write unit tests, because I struggled with git. It happens from time to time. I'm going to go through a tutorial after this sprint. I just have to find the appropriate one. 

I was working overtime... for like half an hour. Docs seems to be easy-peasy and I'll do them shortly after Daily Scrum.

I want to document a current codebase. Testing is hard. A movement system is so complex, even at this point. I wrote a test, but it doesn't work. A combat entity is not added to an engine. I have to figure out what's going on. If I'm lucky, I will do some refactoring.
