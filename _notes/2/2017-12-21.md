I added a Sloth, he is a cool buddy. YARL will not deliver any ground breaking feature, but I can at least do my best to make the game funny.

Yesterday I added random monster generation. Today I want to put them on map and make them act as an obstacle.

I should make use of burn-down charts to see how quick is my progress. This way I would know if a sprint goal is in danger and I could act accordingly.

I think a scrum board would be nice, but an Excel sheet should be just as good. Keeping this stuff in text files is a weird idea.

The only impediment I see is that I wouldn't meet a deadline, but a focus factor is low and time-box is long enough, so this shouldn't happen.
