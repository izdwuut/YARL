Today I want to keep this "meeting" brief. The Scrum Guide says 15m tops, but I think 20m should be OK. Today it was 10m.

I set an over-ambitious goal for Friday. I didn't manage to work on a combat system, but I did everything else - unit testing and combat entity. Which is perfectly OK - I'll try to do it today. I also want to move tasks from "to verify" to "done" and write unit tests.
