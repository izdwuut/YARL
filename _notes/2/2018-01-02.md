I want to clean up code in an upcoming sprint.

Okay, I think I know a partial solution to a bare fists/disarm problem. A disarmed creature drops it's weapon on a floor. Base damage can be calculated using creature's stats like strength.

I created a WinScreen. To win a game (at least for now) a player has to kill every monster in a dungeon.

I have couple things to do:

* Fix docs bugs.
* Mark a current revision as v0.1.0 (bump version in a Gradle script).
* Modify README to include libs I use.

Now I know that I shouldn't close a sprint on the last day, let alone add new features. It was dumb.
