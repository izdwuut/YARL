I created a website you're looking at right now. I didn't manage to implement [a theme](https://i.imgur.com/fImxfSD.png) I designed so I decided to use [a default](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) Jekyll theme. I have uploaded my Daily Scrum notes. I don't think they have much value, but I did it for the sake of transparency. I was thinking how to bail out of it, so I hope you enjoy them. I stopped entering time spent - I let Trello track it. While I still occasionally enter time spent on writing Daily Scrum notes, I plan to use [a dedicated card](https://trello.com/c/kvPUdjU3/107-daily-scrum-r).
