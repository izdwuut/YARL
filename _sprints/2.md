These notes might be a bit chaotic. My only true goal was [to get a hang of Scrum](https://i.imgur.com/D74NB5B.jpg). I planned on writing Daily Scrum notes, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. [And I wrote them indeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/7ofi0r/sharing_saturday_188/dsa8wj7/). I was trying to use Excel as a Scrum Board but I failed miserably. I slipped on flyweight factory refactoring and failed to close the sprint on time. I also forgot I should probably add a win screen or something. Closing the sprint was a traumatic experience, I assure you. It will only get better, though.
