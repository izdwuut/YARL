The first sprint wasn't really a sprint. I just had a list of features I want to implement and I was coding them. I wasn't using Scrum back then, that's why there are no notes here. Due to some perturbations [I didn't release it as v0.1.0](http://leisuresuitlarry.wikia.com/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_4:_The_Missing_Floppies) but merged it with [the next release]({{ 'sprints/2.html' | relative_url }}) instead.
